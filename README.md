My friend told me a project like this would look good so this was my first
machine-learning project and although there's so much more to learn, I feel like
I have definitely learned a bit.
A gist of what this project is really about:
We trained a network to predict gender based on the given weight and height of an
individual. It draws assumptions after doing calculations on already given data with 
heights and weights gender associated with each person.
After seeing what I canreally do with this, I have a few ideas in mind of how I can apply
this to other projects but the difficulty is gonna be crazy.
Anyways, thanks for checking it out!!!
